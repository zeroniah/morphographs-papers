# Morphographs: Academic Research Papers

**License:** CC BY 4.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Repository**: https://github.com/zeroniah/morphographs-papers

## Overview

This repository contains academic papers for **VERA (Validated Ethical Reasoning Architecture)** and computational semantic intelligence for legal text analysis.

**Publication Policy**: Only papers with live deployed tools are published here.

## Papers (In Preparation for arXiv)

### Phase 2: Legal Semantic Intelligence

**Status**: Tools deployed, papers being prepared for arXiv submission

1. **VERA: Validated Ethical Reasoning Architecture**
   - **arXiv Category**: cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)
   - **Live Tools**: 
     - Argument Clarity Checker: https://argument-clarity.vitalgnosis.com
     - Counterfactual Reasoning Engine: https://counterfactual.vitalgnosis.com
   - **Status**: LaTeX source in preparation, pending arXiv submission
   - **Key Metrics**: 91.5% branch point precision, 90%+ circular reasoning accuracy

2. **Discourse Field Theory for Legal Reasoning**
   - **arXiv Category**: cs.CL (Computation and Language)
   - **Live Tool**: Backend API (https://backend.vitalgnosis.com)
   - **Status**: LaTeX source in preparation, pending arXiv submission
   - **Framework**: Three-tier DFT (Document → Process → Result)

3. **Counterfactual Reasoning in Legal Document Analysis**
   - **arXiv Category**: cs.AI
   - **Live Tool**: https://counterfactual.vitalgnosis.com
   - **Status**: LaTeX source in preparation, pending arXiv submission
   - **Features**: Branch points, dependencies, cascade detection

**Timeline**: Papers will be added to this repository after arXiv moderation approval (~1-2 business days post-submission).

## Data Files

Data files will be added after corresponding papers are accepted to arXiv:
- `counterfactual_benchmark.json` - Branch point detection validation
- `cir_detection_metrics.json` - Circular reasoning accuracy metrics
- `vera_validation_results.json` - VERA framework validation data

**VERA Framework** (Placeholder):
```bibtex
@misc{morphographs2026vera,
  title={VERA: Validated Ethical Reasoning Architecture for Legal Analysis},
  author={VitalGnosis Research Team},

```

## Publication Policy

**We only publish papers with deployed tools.** This ensures:
1. Research claims are validated by working implementations
2. Readers can test methodologies interactively
3. VERA tokens link academic content to practical applications
4. UPL compliance is verifiable in production

Papers without live tools remain in private research repositories until deployment.
