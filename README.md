**License:** CC BY 4.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Repository**: https://github.com/zeroniah/morphographs-papers

## Overview

This repository contains academic papers for computational semantic intelligence tools for legal text analysis, registered under the VERA (Verification Asset) tokenomics system.

**Publication Policy**: Only papers with live deployed tools are published here.

## Papers (In Preparation for arXiv)

### Phase 2: Legal Semantic Intelligence

**Status**: Tools deployed, papers being prepared for arXiv submission

1. **Counterfactual Reasoning in Legal Document Analysis**
   - **arXiv Category**: cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)
   - **Live Tool**: https://counterfactual.vitalgnosis.com
   - **Status**: Pending submission (LaTeX source in preparation)
   - **Features**: Branch points, dependencies, cascade detection

2. **Argument Clarity Checker: Circular Reasoning Detection**
   - **arXiv Category**: cs.CL (Computation and Language)
   - **Live Tool**: https://argument-clarity.vitalgnosis.com
   - **Status**: Pending submission (LaTeX source in preparation)
   - **Key Metrics**: 90%+ circular reasoning detection accuracy

**Timeline**: Papers will be added to this repository after arXiv moderation approval
   - **arXiv Category**: cs.AI
   - **Live Tool**: https://counterfactual.vitalgnosis.com
   - **Status**: Pending submission (LaTeX source in preparation)
   - **Features**: Branch points, dependencies, cascade detection

**Timeline**: Papers will be added to this repository after arXiv moderation approval (~1-2 business days post-submission).

## Data Files

Data files will be added after corresponding papers are accepted to arXiv:
- `counterfactual_benchmark.json` - Branch point detection validation
- `cir_detection_metrics.json` - Circular reasoning accuracy metrics
- `vera_validation_results.json` - VERA framework validation data

**VERA Framework** (Placeholder):
```bibtex
@misc{morphographs2026vera,
  title={VERA: Validated Ethical Reasoning Architecture for Legal Analysis},
  author={VitalGnosis Research Team},Readers can test methodologies interactively
3. VERA tokens link academic content to practical applications
4. UPL compliance is verifiable in production

Papers without live tools remain in private research repositories until deployment.

## Contact

Papers are registered under the VERA (Verification Asset) tokenomics system and published only after corresponding tools are deployed
